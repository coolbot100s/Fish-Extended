# Fishing Expanded  

A mod for [WebFishing](https://webfishing.pro), adding new fish to collect and befriend!  
We aim to keep a vanilla style and balance while adding extra content and showcasing some of our beloved underwater friends who couldn't make it into the base game.  

### Installation  

#### Thunderstore
You can use [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/GardenGals/Fishing_Expanded/) to install this mod!

#### Hook Line Sinker
This mod is also available to be installed using [Hook, Line, &, Sinker](https://hooklinesinker.lol), an easy-to-use launcher for WebFishing mods.

#### Manual Install
This mod requires [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave) and [Lure](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure) (at least v2.2.2), don't worry, they're both easy to install or uninstall at any time.  
After you've installed the dependencies simply extract the latest [release](https://github.com/coolbot100s/FishingExpanded/releases) into your new mods folder!  
You should have something that looks like this at `...\steamapps\common\WEBFISHING\GDWeave\mods`

If you're having trouble, make sure you've installed GDWeave's dependency, [.NET8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Keep in mind that while you can play this mod in lobbies, your friends will need to install the mod as well to see your new catches!  
Feel free to ask for help in the [Garden Gals Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qxRVkGDjdJ) in the dedicated channel.   

## New Fish!  
Currently, this mod adds 12 new creatures, 6 saltwater and 6 freshwater.  
We've done our best to integrate these into the vanilla game without feeling overwhelming or out of place while adding some flavor.  
If you'd like to meet the cast, then proceed but be warned... spoilers ahead!

Huge thanks to the lovely people behind GDWeave and especially [Sulayre](https://github.com/Sulayre) for the creation of Lure making this possible.  
This game is new, and the modding scene is even newer, it barely exists right now yet everyone in the WebFishing Community has been kind and supportive, it took a matter of hours to make this mod thanks to their work.  
As always, are created by Kchem.  
This mod was generated using [Hatchery](https://github.com/coolbot100s/Hatchery/tree/main), so check it out if you'd like to add your own fish to the game!
